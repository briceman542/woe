Veterans

Veterans are named unit leaders. By gaining experience in campaign play, normal leaders can become veterans and veterans can improve and gain traits and stat increases that make them unique. Vice versa, they can suffer injuries when defeated and even die forever. They may acquire skills and equipment to help them in their role or even provide bonuses to their comrades through excellent leadership (or perhaps fear!)

The goal of this document is good casual campaign play rules. Not interested in exact balance or points, but in a loose framework for representing custom named heroes on the battlefield, leveling them up and getting them killed.
Creation and Advancements
A veteran is created at the end of a campaign game, where a unit has accumulated one or more experience points. That unit’s leader becomes a Veteran and a named character! Give them a name! Keep track of that character’s experience from now on. Each experience point brings them closer to leveling up again.

Earning Experience Points
A unit earns experience points throughout the game based on their performance. At the end of the battle, a unit receives 0 XP if it was scattered. It receives half (rounding down) if it is routing at the end of the game, or routed off the edge of the table.

Situation
XP Gained
Unit won a combat round
1
… and caused the enemy to break.
+1
… against a superior opponent. (Higher Res, Higher Str, Higher SV or Number of attacks)
+1

Picking Advancements
Each time a veteran acquires a new level, they can pick (or roll for) an advancement. I suggest picking an advancement that makes sense given the performance of the unit in the game! If nothing jumps out to you, give it a roll instead. 

A character can have 5 total advancements, 1 of each level. Some advancements scale with the advancement level used to buy them. This is represented by Advancement Level (AL) in the chart e.g. STR +.

You can upgrade a previously bought Advancement with a higher AL version and rebuy the lower enhancement. E.g. The veteran has Level 1: STR + AL and Level 2: Wound + AL.  When the veteran levels up to 3, you can choose to purchase Level 3: STR + AL, granting +3 STR, and then reuse that Level 1 slot for any valid level 1 advac
Leader abilities (e.g. Berserker Leader) make the unit the veteran leads have that trait, i.e. the unit gains Berserk. Some of these are a little different. E.g. Tough Leader gives the unit a tough rating, not every individual in the unit.

Death and Dismemberment
Any time a veteran’s unit is scattered or the veteran is “killed” by taking wounds, you must roll on the Death and Dismemberment table. Be sure to check for all the modifiers which may apply. You don’t have to roll if the unit successfully routed off of your friendly board edge.
