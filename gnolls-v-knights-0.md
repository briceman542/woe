# Campaign Background
## Riversworth

**Riverworth** is a quiet peaceful farming community in southern **Aradonia**. The community is famous for being the birthplace and childhood home of **Sir Rerrick Castellian the Strong**, a knight famous for his adventures as a member of the **Sons of Dorn** in the new world in recent times.

**Riverworth** sits in rough and rocky farmland. The ground is filled with stones which must be cleared to plant. The landscape is criss crossed by piled stone fences. The area is fairly remote and far removed from the hustle and bustle of modern **Aradonian** life. It is part of the **County Dirk**, which stretches for much of the south eastern border all the way to the foot of the Fangs, the imposing mountains to the east. Much of this land is sparsely populated and exists as a border territory. Its primary trade route is **Everston**, a walled trade town, some 200 miles down river. 

The town hasn't seen trouble in years. It's people are tough pioneer folk, able to handle their own problems and exists on the edge of the largely cosmopolitan **Aradonia**. It's population is 30% Dwarven and 65% human, and 5% other. 

**Riversworth** pays fealty to the **Count of Dirk, Lord Royce**. He makes his home in **Everston**. He is a just and honorable lord, but a minor one, willing to try his hand at commerce to sustain his family's wealth. The last 50 years have been good for the **Royce** family, but their holdings remain remote and largely overlooked in modern **Aradonian** high society. He has taken to the field of battle as an attendant only and never fought in battle. His finances could field a few thousand mercenaries to the field for a short campaign, but anything longer than a year would prove disastrous. 

A hermit, going only by **Orin** when he rarely emerges, has bought and purchased an old homestead on the edge of **Riversworth**. The folk steer clear of him and he keeps to his own business. He is famously unfriendly, but many in **Riversworth** have a rough nature, so most pay him no mind.

## The Ancient Gnollwood
The eastern forest, from **Riversmeet** to the Fangs was known as **Gnollwood** by the mountain dwarves, but gnolls haven’t been seen in these parts for hundreds of years. That’s all changing. 

{{Gnoll warlord name}}, Chief of the **Sludge Fangs** brings leads his tribe from beyond the tall mountains, in search of new slaves and plunder.
