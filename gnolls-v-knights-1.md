# Part 1: KICKING THE HORNET’S NEST  
[Background](/woe/gnolls-v-knights-0/)

**Synopsis**: Hunters attack a gnoll warren with flammable material in tow. They must act quickly and decisively to set a fire and fill the warrens with smoke. If they linger, the reinforcements will arrive from below, overwhelming them.

## Scenario Background

**Albert Valon**, 38, miller, loves to hunt. And so it was that he came to find himself tracking a wounded deer. Some 10 miles east of **Riversworth**, he tracked this deer to a deep hole in the ground, a cave of sorts... dug out with claws? No matter, he mustered his courage and went inside. The stench was overwhelming and the bear nowhere to be found. What he did find were hundreds of yipping, howling baby humanoids, beastmen! Half man, half hyena! Rousing the anger of a full grown gnoll, **Albert** fled for his life, back to **Riversworth**, barely evading his captors.

Telling his tale at the tavern, a grizzled trapper named **Joriah Hargraves** speaks up. He has met these creatures before. Gnolls! And once fully grown, they will hound these parts for decades! Something must be done.

And so it was that **Joriah Hargraves** and **Albert Valon** led a group of men to the gnoll warrens, to stamp out this gnoll menace before it became a serious threat. They bring a small decanter of oil and a cart load of charcoal, bows and hand weapons. They are going to smoke them out.

Unfortunately for them, they were walking into a trap.

## Forces 
### Knights 
Knights bring 6 order dice, a mixture of full and half units and anywhere in between. They can bring 1 Dwarven unit, either warriors or archers. They can be bowmen, foot retainers and peasants, meant to represent the ragtag collection of pioneer folk, setting out into the woods to defend their homes.
Characters

**Knight Characters**   
**Joriah Hargraves** (Level 1 - +1 Wound)   
**Albert Valon** (Level 1 - Grants Dead Eye shot). 

**Charcoal Cart**  
They need a cart model that has all of the charcoal. The cart is pulled by draft horses and is heavily laden. It is a RES 8 chariot model with no attacks.It is fast 8 (but heavily laden). It has 1 driver. He has a hand weapon. If the driver is killed (by the chariot rolls), a model from another unit may become the driver by ending its movement within 1” of the cart.

### Gnolls
5 order dice (put only 4 in bag; see below) of whatever they would like, full and half units as they see fit. This is meant to represent a “garrison” of adolescent and elder gnolls left behind to defend the warrens while the warlord and the rest of the **Sludge Fangs** are off scouting and seeking plunder. The gnolls may press their young into service as swarms of baby gnolls and perhaps even the warren matriarch will make an appearance.

Gnolls choose a stand of trees/forest and hidden deploy there.

**Hidden deployment**  
Pick a terrain feature before any deployments. Make a note of which unit is deployed there. Do not add this unit’s order die to the bag. In game, when an enemy comes issues an order within 20” of this terrain feature, you may attempt to react as if affected by the Ambush order. 

**On Pass** | Place the unit either within or base-to-base with the terrain feature. Put set aside order die into play, turned to the side of the reaction. React as normal successful reaction.
**On Fail** | Place the unit either within or base-to-base with the terrain feature. Put the set aside order die into place as an AMBUSH order. They have revealed themselves.

**Reinforcements**  
*At the beginning of each turn*, the gnoll player rolls for reinforcements.  
**On a 5+**, a gnoll unit emerges from an unguarded warren entrance (see below) to fight. 
Place all models in the unit **within 5”** an unguarded warren. 
Put a new order dice into play next to this unit, set to the **AMBUSH** side. 

## Setup

Deploy terrain, lots of forests, a combination of heavy and light woodlands. This encounter happens in the woods.  

Place 2 gnoll warren markers on the map, 18" from the gnoll edge. 24 and 48" from the side. these are gnoll warren entrances. 

## Deployment  
 
**Gnoll** deployment is 18”. Their hidden deploy can be any forest.   

**Knight** deployment is 12”.  

An **warren entrance** is guarded if there are only non-gnolls within 5" of it.

## Objectives  
**Knights** must get the cart within 5" of a guarded gnoll hole. Then the cart must make a rally action to dump the charcoal and light the fire. The hole is now lit. Knights have won the game.

**Gnolls** must prevent this, delaying the knights until their numbers can overwhelm them. 

The game goes **6 turns**. If the cart is within 5" of a gnoll warren entrance, a **7th turn is played**. Otherwise the game ends; gnolls wins.

* **Gnolls** win is the cart is destroyed. 
* **Gnolls** win if all knights flee or are killed. 
* **Knights** win if they light the fire on an entrance. The smoke quickly builds up in the warren, suffocating lots of baby gnolls. Poor lil guys =(

## Post Battle
**Gnoll Victory** 
The gnoll warrens are preserved and more are being dug all the time. The need for food is great. The gnolls move west in force, right towards Riversworth. Riversworth prepares to defend itself and sends a messenger to Everston with news.

**Knight Victory** 
This batch of gnoll warrens has been destroyed but there are others. Gnolls seek to build their strength through reaving and raiding rather than all out assault. Riversworth, sure that their vigilance has won the day, celebrates and hails its brave adventurers as heroes.
